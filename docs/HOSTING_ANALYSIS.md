- CloudFront: ~$0.50-4/month (depends on traffic)
- Route53 DNS: ~$0.50/month

**Annual Savings**: **$588-540** (90-96% reduction)

---

### 5. Traditional VPS (Current)
**Cost**: **$50/month** ($600/year)
**Why Overkill**:
- ❌ **Server maintenance overhead**
- ❌ **Complex deployment process**
- ❌ **Single point of failure**
- ❌ **No CDN distribution** (unless configured)
- ❌ **Over-provisioned resources** for static content

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Current VPS Limitations
- **Single geographic location** (unless multi-region setup)
- **No CDN** (unless manually configured)
- **Server response overhead** for static files
- **Maintenance downtime** during updates

### Static Hosting + CDN Benefits
- **Global edge locations** (faster worldwide access)
- **Aggressive caching** of static assets
- **Elimination of server processing** overhead
- **Automatic scaling** during traffic spikes
- **99.9%+ uptime** SLAs

### Expected Performance Improvements
- **20-50% faster load times** globally (CDN edge serving)
- **Better SEO scores** (Core Web Vitals improvement)
- **Improved user experience** worldwide
- **Higher availability** (no single server failure point)

## Migration Considerations

### Technical Requirements
1. **Static Export Capability**: Verify Next.js can export static files
2. **Asset Optimization**: Already completed (99.2% image reduction)
3. **Domain Configuration**: Update DNS to point to new hosting
4. **SSL Certificate**: Automatic with all recommended options

### Migration Steps (GitHub Pages Example)
1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
2. **Configure build action** for Next.js static export
3. **Update domain DNS** records
4. **Test deployment** and functionality
5. **Monitor performance** and costs

### Rollback Plan
- Keep VPS running during initial testing
- DNS TTL set low for quick rollback if needed
- Full backup of current setup documented

- **Week 4**: VPS decommission after verification

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Worst Case**: Rollback to VPS (plan documented)
- **Most Likely**: Improved performance + $600/year savings
