# Contributing to Pattern Craft

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Pattern Craft! Your support enhances our highly optimized pattern library and improves the overall user experience.

**âœ¨ Recent Achievements**: Pattern Craft has achieved 99.2% asset reduction, 1-1.5s load times, and $600/year hosting savings. All contributions help maintain this high performance standard.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in multiple ways:

- Add new background patterns
- Enhance existing patterns
- Report issues or bugs
- Submit improvements to documentation

## Adding New Patterns

To expand the pattern collection:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your forked repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pattern-craft.git
   cd pattern-craft
   ```
3. **Create a new feature branch** for your pattern:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/pattern-name
   ```
4. **Navigate** to the patterns directory:
   ```bash
   cd src/app/utils/patterns/
   ```
5. **Create your pattern** following the established format:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "new-pattern-id",
     name: "Pattern Display Name",
     badge: "New",
     style: {
       background: "#fff",
       backgroundImage: `linear-gradient(to right, #f0f0f0 1px, transparent 1px)`
       backgroundSize: "96px 64px",
     },
     code: `<div className="min-h-screen w-full bg-white relative"><div className="absolute inset-0 z-0" /></div>`,
   }
   ```
6. **Test your pattern** in the development environment to ensure it renders correctly.
7. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new pattern-name pattern"
   git push origin feature/pattern-name
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request** against the main repository:
   - Provide a clear description of your pattern
   - Add screenshots for visual reference
   - Mention any specifics or considerations

## Pattern Categories

When creating patterns, consider organizing them into these categories:

- **Gradient** - Color transitions and blends
- **Geometric** - Grids, dots, lines, shapes  
- **Decorative** - Subtle background textures
- **Effects** - Clean and simple designs

## Pattern Structure Guidelines

### Complete Pattern Format

```typescript
{
  id: "descriptive-pattern-id",           // kebab-case, unique identifier
  name: "Human Readable Pattern Name",     // Proper case display name
  badge: "New",                           // Optional: "New", "Popular", or omit
  style: {
    background: "#ffffff",               // Base background color
    backgroundImage: `
      linear-gradient(to right, #f0f0f0 1px, transparent 1px),
      radial-gradient(circle 800px at 100% 200px, #d5c5ff, transparent)
    `,                                    // CSS background patterns
    backgroundSize: "96px 64px, 100% 100%", // Pattern sizing
  },
  code: `<div className="min-h-screen w-full bg-white relative">
  {/* Pattern Name Background */}
  <div
    className="absolute inset-0 z-0"
    style={{
      backgroundImage: \`
        linear-gradient(to right, #f0f0f0 1px, transparent 1px),
        radial-gradient(circle 800px at 100% 200px, #d5c5ff, transparent)
      \`,
      backgroundSize: "96px 64px, 100% 100%",
    }}
  />
  {/* Your Content/Components */}
</div>`,
}
```

### Pattern Creation Best Practices

1. **ID Naming**:
   - Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
   - Be descriptive: `geometric-grid-dots` not `pattern1`
   - Include pattern type: `gradient-sunset`, `geometric-hexagon`

2. **Display Names**:
   - Use proper case: "Geometric Grid Dots"
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Avoid technical jargon in user-facing names

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use CSS gradients over images when possible
   - Avoid complex calculations in background patterns
   - Test rendering performance on slower devices
   - Keep pattern file sizes minimal

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use relative units (%, em, rem) where appropriate
   - Test patterns on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Ensure patterns scale well across screen sizes
   - Avoid fixed pixel values that break on small screens

5. **Color Guidelines**:
   - Use accessible color combinations
   - Provide sufficient contrast for overlaid text
   - Consider both light and dark theme compatibility
   - Use semantic color names in comments

6. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Include proper JSX formatting
   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
   - Add comments for complex pattern logic

## Testing Checklist

Before submitting your pattern:

- [ ] Pattern renders correctly in development mode
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Pattern ID is unique and descriptive
- [ ] Code follows established formatting
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Pattern is visually distinct from existing ones

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Follow the existing code style and pattern structure exactly
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, kebab-case IDs and proper display names
- **Quality**: Ensure patterns are professional, visually appealing, and accessible
- **Performance**: Optimize patterns for fast rendering and minimal resource usage
- **Responsiveness**: Test patterns thoroughly across different screen sizes
- **Uniqueness**: Avoid duplicating existing patterns; add meaningful variety
- **Documentation**: Include clear, well-formatted code examples

## Development Setup

Ensure you have the following tools before starting development:

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)
- **Yarn/NPM** for package management

## Testing Your Changes

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Verify changes across different browsers
3. Ensure no console errors or warnings are introduced
