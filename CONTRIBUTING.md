# Contributing to Pattern Craft

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Pattern Craft! Your support enhances our project by enriching the pattern library and improving the overall user experience.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in multiple ways:

- Add new background patterns
- Enhance existing patterns
- Report issues or bugs
- Submit improvements to documentation

## Adding New Patterns

To expand the pattern collection:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your forked repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pattern-craft.git
   cd pattern-craft
   ```
3. **Create a new feature branch** for your pattern:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/pattern-name
   ```
4. **Navigate** to the patterns directory:
   ```bash
   cd src/app/utils/patterns/
   ```
5. **Create your pattern** following the established format:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "new-pattern-id",
     name: "Pattern Display Name",
     badge: "New",
     style: {
       background: "#fff",
       backgroundImage: `linear-gradient(to right, #f0f0f0 1px, transparent 1px)`
       backgroundSize: "96px 64px",
     },
     code: `<div className="min-h-screen w-full bg-white relative"><div className="absolute inset-0 z-0" /></div>`,
   }
   ```
6. **Test your pattern** in the development environment to ensure it renders correctly.
7. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new pattern-name pattern"
   git push origin feature/pattern-name
   ```
8. **Create a Pull Request** against the main repository:
   - Provide a clear description of your pattern
   - Add screenshots for visual reference
   - Mention any specifics or considerations

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Follow the existing code style and pattern structure
- **Naming**: Use descriptive IDs and meaningful display names
- **Quality**: Ensure patterns are professional and visually appealing
- **Performance**: Optimize patterns for fast rendering
- **Responsiveness**: Test patterns on multiple screen sizes
- **Uniqueness**: Avoid duplicating existing patterns

## Development Setup

Ensure you have the following tools before starting development:

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)
- **Yarn/NPM** for package management

## Testing Your Changes

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Verify changes across different browsers
3. Ensure no console errors or warnings are introduced
